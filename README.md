# **Lung-Cancer-Prediction**
Lung Cancer Prediction Model and High-Risk Group Prediction Using Machine Learning

### Project Overview

This repository contains a predictive model for lung cancer, leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze and predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on various input features. The project explores the impact of different predictive models and clustering algorithms on accuracy and subgroup identification. The project is a part of my final capstone project for a Computational Science course (Fall 2023).

### Introduction

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust lung cancer prediction model using machine learning techniques. The project involves the implementation and comparison of various predictive models, such as Logistic Regression and KNN, to analyze their performance on both the original dataset and a PCA-transformed version.

Additionally, the project explores the application of the K Means Clustering algorithm to identify patient subgroups based on shared characteristics. The README provides an overview of the project and its structure.

### Key Features

- **Predictive Models:** Implementation and comparison of Logistic Regression and KNN models.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Application of the K Means Clustering algorithm for identifying patient subgroups.
- **Dataset Transformation:** Exploration of PCA transformation for feature reduction.
